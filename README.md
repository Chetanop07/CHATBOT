A personal assistant that was developed by me when I was learning c++ programming.  
Yes! It actually speaks. :D

## What Assistant Can Do for Me?
Well well! Have a look at these features:
* Assistant can actually talk to you.
* Ask your Assistant to perform basic mathematical operations.
* It can play songs for you.
* Don't you know what day is today? Ask your Assistant then.
* Not Satisfyied? You can add your own functionalities too.
* And, Assistant is not married yet!

## How to Add/Delete/Change Commands?
**Genral Commands:**
  * If you are using Windows then start `createCommandFile.exe`.
  * If you are on Linux then go in terminal and type `./createCommandFile`.
  * Choose the option for whatever editing you need and press enter.
  * Perform the edting.

> *__Note:__*  
> 1. *Do not add any punctuation marks at the end of the orders. Assistant will automatically handle them.*
> 2. *You need to add punctuations marks in the respnses for explaining proper expressions to the Assistant for speaking.*  

**Math Opearions:**  
All the steps are same but instead of `createCommandFile.exe` use `mathCommandFile.exe`  and in linux use `./mathCommandFile` instead of `./createCommandFile`.  

**Advanced Operations:**  
Advance operaions include playing music and telling dates. You can add keywords for trigerring your advance commands and then edit the respond in `AdvanceCommandFile.cpp`.
